# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Final Peer Review Exam

For this work I made a mistake uploading the dataset and sadly I cannot correct it (I don't know how). This being said, the scrip, if executed, will automatically download and unzip the data, therefore there is no real need of having the data in this repository!

Files

   CodeBook.md a code book that describes all the variables and files and the explanations to use the resulting script

  run_analysis.R performs the data cleaning and preparation. Moreover, it merges the training and the test sets to create one data set; it extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement; uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set ; labels the data set with descriptive variable names ; from the previous dataset it creates a second tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
   
   FinalData.txt is the resulting txt file with the final dataset after going through all the previously described sequences.
